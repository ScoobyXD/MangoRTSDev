# My Triage Tests

Coverage Status:
- Business Logic Covered By Scenarios: 100%
- Business Logic Covered By Automated Tests: 0% (rule IDs are not mapped to automated tests yet)

## Business Logic

MT1 - My Triage is the current user's personal email triage queue and must not show another user's private triage items.
MT2 - Adding a message to My Triage requires a connected personal mailbox message ID that can be read from the user's email connection.
MT3 - Batch triage adds must clean blank message IDs, dedupe repeated IDs, and process no more than 50 messages in one request.
MT4 - Adding the same user/message pair again refreshes the stored message snapshot instead of creating a duplicate triage row.
MT5 - Removing a My Triage item only removes the current user's row for that message.
MT6 - Converting triage messages requires a company, at least one triage message, and a valid conversion target.
MT7 - Conversion must read or refresh the latest mailbox message snapshot before creating workspace records from the email.
MT8 - If the conversion mode is not explicit, the target mode is inferred from the provided node, logic gate, project, folder, parent entity, or new gate header fields.
MT9 - Converting into an existing logic gate requires edit access to that logic gate.
MT10 - Converting into an existing node requires edit access to the node and edit access to any provided logic gate context.
MT11 - Converting into a new logic gate requires a header/title and creates the logic gate, board/card records, and email-derived work item records together.
MT12 - Converting into a folder or project creates email-derived node records and places or relates them to the selected target.
MT13 - Converting into a legacy folder requires edit access to that folder, and converting into a V2 Explorer parent requires edit access to the parent container.
MT14 - Converting into a project requires project edit access and creates the project relationship/projection records needed for the new work item.
MT15 - Conversion defaults the status to Pending and priority to 3 when those values are not provided.
MT16 - Explicit conversion priority must be between 1 and 5.
MT17 - Successful conversion removes the converted messages from My Triage and returns the deleted message IDs.
MT18 - Successful conversion emits the triage/workspace/projection events needed for other views to refresh.
MT19 - Reverting a converted email restores the triage item from the email-node placement and removes the workspace record that was created from that conversion.

## Scenarios

### Scenario MT-S1: Personal Triage Add, Refresh, List, And Delete

Business logic covered:
- MT1
- MT2
- MT3
- MT4
- MT5

Given:
- User A and User B both belong to the same company.
- User A has a connected personal mailbox with messages M1 and M2.
- User B has no ownership over User A's personal triage rows.

Expected:
- User A can add M1 and M2 to My Triage.
- Re-adding M1 refreshes User A's stored snapshot and does not create a duplicate.
- A batch containing blanks, repeated IDs, and more than 50 IDs is cleaned and capped before processing.
- User A sees only User A's personal triage items.
- User B does not see or delete User A's personal triage item.
- Deleting M1 removes only User A's triage row for M1.

### Scenario MT-S2: Convert To Existing Workspace Targets

Business logic covered:
- MT6
- MT7
- MT8
- MT9
- MT10
- MT15
- MT16
- MT17
- MT18

Given:
- A user has personal triage messages ready to convert.
- The request targets an existing logic gate, or an existing node with optional logic gate context.
- The user may have view-only or edit access to those targets.

Expected:
- Conversion fails when company, messages, or target data is missing.
- Conversion refreshes the message snapshot before creating workspace records.
- Target mode is inferred when the request omits it but includes a clear node or logic gate target.
- Conversion into an existing logic gate succeeds only with edit access to that logic gate.
- Conversion into an existing node succeeds only with edit access to the node and optional logic gate context.
- Missing status defaults to Pending.
- Missing priority defaults to 3, and priority outside 1 through 5 is rejected.
- Successful conversion removes the triage messages and emits the refresh events.

### Scenario MT-S3: Convert To New Gate, Folder, Or Project

Business logic covered:
- MT6
- MT7
- MT8
- MT11
- MT12
- MT13
- MT14
- MT15
- MT16
- MT17
- MT18

Given:
- A user has personal triage messages ready to convert.
- The request targets a new logic gate, a folder/parent entity, or a project.

Expected:
- A new logic gate conversion requires a title/header and creates the gate plus related work records together.
- A folder conversion places the new work item under the selected folder or V2 parent only when the user can edit that parent.
- A project conversion requires project edit access and creates the project relationship/projection records.
- Successful conversion removes the source triage messages and emits refresh events.

### Scenario MT-S4: Revert Converted Email

Business logic covered:
- MT19

Given:
- A triage message was converted into a workspace node.
- The system still has enough email-node placement data to identify the conversion.

Expected:
- Reverting restores the message to My Triage.
- Reverting removes the workspace node/card created by that conversion.
- Reverting does not remove unrelated workspace records.
